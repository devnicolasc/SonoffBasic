# SonoffBasic
SonoffBasic allows to control Sonoff switches via the Ewelink cloud, with a very basic features.

⚠️ Project was tested on sonoff basic only. Other devices will be tested and adjust in the future.

* Username is email address. 
* Ewelink account region must be one of **'us'**, **'eu'** or **'cn'**.
* install SonoffBasic (https://pypi.org/project/SonoffBasic/)

available params (all values in string format):
    * username - email address (required) 
    * password (required)
    * region (optional) default *'us'*
    * timezone (optional) default *'US/Pacific'*

    [{'name': 'taco', 'deviceid': '1000157898', 'outletid': 0, 'status': 'on'}, 
    {'name': 'Irrigation', 'deviceid': '100015b23r', 'outletid': 0, 'status': 'off'}]
    ```
* Control the device
    ```python 
    >>> sonoff.change_device_status(deviceid = '1000157898',
                                    new_status = 'off'
                                    )
